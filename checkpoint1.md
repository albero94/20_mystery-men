# Checkpoint 1

In our work distribution and timeline plan, we considered the amount of time that we had for this first checkpoint and we tried not to overestimate the amount of effort we would be able to do. We are happy with the progress made so far, but we feel that we should devote more time each week to the project.

## What changes were necessary in the project
After a conversation between Sam and Gabe, we redefined some of our goals and made them more ambitious. The major change is that we want to end up having a mobile application that can connect to the cloud application to manage the system as an administrator and operate the lock directly. This application would only be used by the home owners as they could directly decide the base of users the door recognizes and open whenever desired. 

This new more ambitious goal, requires changes in our cloud application as it needs new functionalities to manage permissions, and the creation of a mobile application that can interface with the cloud one.

## Where we fell behind
The research about the face API has been done and even tested with a console application that allows you to compare files in your system or that are available in the Internet.

Required APIs have been identified for interfacing with the camera and the motor. They have been installed on the Raspberry Pi. The camera has been tested and is functional, but it is not connected with the cloud API yet.

As we also have a new goal, we can consider that we fell behind in making any progress there, although we have been having the app idea in our mind from the beginning and we have already discussed about how that could work.

## What we will do to catch up
We are planning to put more weekly hours of work into the project. We also feel that the beginnings can always be hard as you are not sure in which direction you are going and planning and organizing the tasks in a project takes time. Now that we have a clear idea of our goal, we believe that we will make progress faster.
